## Beef and Pineapple Curry

#### Serves 2

I use pineapple rings in this, as I find pre-diced pineapple chunks too big, 
so prefer to chop rings into smaller chunks. You can of course used diced 
pineapple.

### Ingredients
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves
* 20g ginger, chopped
* 1 tsp red chilli, chopped
* 1 tsp coriander, ground
* 1 tsp cumin, ground
* 1 tsp turmeric, ground
* 1 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1 1/2 tsp fennel Seeds
* 350g beef, diced
* 2 tbsp plain yoghurt
* 250ml cocounut cream, thick
* 260g tin pineapple rings in juice, sliced into chunks.

### Method
1. Fry the onion over a moderate heat for 5-10 minutes until golden.
2. Turn the heat down low. Add the garlic, ginger, chillies and spices.
	Cook gently for 2 minutes, stirring all the time.
3. Add the beef, turn up the heat and fry until browned.
4. Add the yoghurt one spoonful at a time, stirring untill completely
	absorbed.
5. Add the coconut cream, pineapple and juice. Simmer gently for 30 mins,
	or until the suace is thickened. Stir frequently to prevent sticking.

Serve with rice.
