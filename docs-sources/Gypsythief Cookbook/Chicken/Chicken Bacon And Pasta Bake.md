## Chicken and Bacon Pasta Bake in a Cheese Sauce

#### Serves 2

### Ingredients
* Pasta for two
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 large cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 350g chicken breast, diced
* 3 rashers of bacon, diced
* 250ml chicken stock
* 1 tsp mixed herbs

#### Cheese Sauce
* 250ml [roux sauce](../../Dictionary of Cooking/Roux Sauce/)
* 200g mature cheddar cheese

### Method
1. Put the pasta on to cook, and preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6 / 200C
2. Whilst the pasta is cooking, fry the onions in a little oil for 5-10
minutes, until nicely golden.
3. Turn the onions down low; add the garlic and paprika and fry gently
for 1 minute
4. Add the chicken and bacon, and fry until sealed.
5. Add the chicken stock and mixed herbs. Bring to the boil, then reduce
to a rolling simmer. You want to reduce to a thick coating whilst
making the cheese sauce.
6. Make the cheese sauce: make a roux with the flour, margarine and
milk; add the cheese and stir until melted.
7. Combine the pasta, chicken and cheese sauce in a casserole dish.
Place in the oven and cook for 20-25mins, until golden and crispy on top.
