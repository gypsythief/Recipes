### Method
1. Melt the ghee, add the onions and stir to breakup. Place a lid on the
 pan and cook gently over a low heat for 10 minutes; remove the lid, turn
 up the heat slightly and cook for a couple of minutes more until golden.
2. Whilst the onions are cooking, add 75g of dried mango to a pan with
 200ml water and the lemon juice. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat 
 to a rolling simmer; aim to boil off most of the liquid by the time the
 onions are done.
3. Turn the heat down low for the onions. Add the coriander, cumin, 
 turmeric, cardamon seeds, fenugreek seeds and chilli powder and cook gently
 for 1 minute. Add the chicken and cook, stirring occaisionally until
 lightly done.
4. Whilst the chicken is cooking, tip the boiled mango into a blender;
 add the garlic, ginger, tomato puree and yoghurt. Blend until smooth.
5. Tip the mango blend into the pan with the chicken. Add the coconut,
 cream and remaining 75g of mango pieces. Simmer gently for 20 minutes.
