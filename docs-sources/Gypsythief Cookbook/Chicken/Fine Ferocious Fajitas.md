## Fine Ferocious Fajitas

#### Serves 2

These aren't too ferocious any more, they've been toned down over time.

If you'd like a bit more kick, increase the cayenne, replace the chillies
with Bird's Eye chillis, and add a tablespoon of white wine vinegar. 

### Ingredients
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 20g ginger, chopped
* 1 tsp red chillies, chopped
* 1 tsp cumin, ground
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp cayenne
* 2 tsp demerara sugar
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 tbsp tomato puree
* 3 bell peppers, fairly finely sliced

### Method
1. Fry the onion over a high heat for 5-10 minutes until well browned.
2. Turn the heat down low. Add the garlic, ginger, chillies, spices and sugar
	Cook gently for 2 minutes, stirring all the time.
3. Add the chicken, turn up the heat and cook until it is just cooked through.
4. Add the tomato puree and a small splash of water; stir well to coat the chicken.
5. Add the pepper strips and cook over a high heat for 5 minutes, until
	the peppers are softened and the chicken is done.

Serve wrapped in tortillas with sour cream or plain yoghurt.
