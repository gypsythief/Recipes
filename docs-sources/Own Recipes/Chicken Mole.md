coriander; fry gently for 1-2 minutes.
3. Add the chicken and fry until sealed.
4. Whilst the chicken is cooking, place the chillies and liquid into a 
blender. Add the garlic, raisins & peanut butter, and blend until 
smooth.
5. Add the blended chillie sauce to the pan; add the cinnamon stick & 
lime juice and stir in the sour cream & chocolate. Bring to the boil, 
reduce the heat and simmer for 20-30 mins.
6. Cook the rice according to your prefered method. Whilst cooking, chop 
the coriandor and grate the lime zest. When the rice is done, drain and 
add the coriander, lime zest and lime juice.
