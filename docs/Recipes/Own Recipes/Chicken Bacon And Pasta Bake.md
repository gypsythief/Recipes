## Chicken and Bacon Pasta Bake in a Cheese Sauce
Serves 2
### Ingredients
* Pasta for two
* 1 Onion, chopped
* 3 Large Cloves of Garlic, crushed
* 1/2 tsp Paprika
* 350g Chicken Breast, diced
* 3 Rashers of Bacon, diced
* 250ml Chicken Stock
* 1 tsp Mixed Herbs

#### Cheese Sauce
* 250ml [Roux Sauce](../Dictionary of Cooking/Roux Sauce/)
* 200g Mature Cheddar Cheese

### Method
1. Put the pasta on to cook, and preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6 / 200C
2. Whilst the pasta is cooking, fry the onions in a little oil for 5-10
minutes, until nicely golden.
3. Turn the onions down low; add the garlic and paprika and fry gently
for 1 minute
4. Add the chicken and bacon, and fry until sealed.
5. Add the chicken stock and mixed herbs. Bring to the boil, then reduce
to a rolling simmer. You want to reduce to a thick coating whilst
making the cheese sauce.
6. Make the cheese sauce: make a roux with the flour, margarine and
milk; add the cheese and stir until melted.
7. Combine the pasta, chicken and cheese sauce in a casserole dish.
Place in the oven and cook for 20-25mins, until golden and crispy on top.
